\section{Introduction}
My literature review supervisor is Prof. Pieter Vermeesch from the Department of Earth Sciences. The topic of my 
literature review will be related to using nuclear tracks in minerals to detect cosmic rays.

\section{Meetings}
We have agreed to initially meet every Wednesday for approximately 30 minutes as an opportunity to discuss the
direction for my literature review. 

Once I have solidified my literature review direction and begun writing the
main content, our meeting frequency will be reduced, as the final literature review should be an 
independent piece of work.

\section{Feedback}
During meetings I will be sharing my findings and thoughts on the topic and receive advice from my supervisor 
on them. At the end of each meeting, my supervisor will assign me suggested tasks to complete for the coming
weeks. 

Another avenue of feedback we agreed on is through email. Any questions that I may have, I can email my 
supervisor about.

Overall, directional feedback will occur during meetings, although feedback on my drafted and final
literature review will be done through GitHub.
